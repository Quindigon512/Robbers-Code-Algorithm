# Robbers-Code-Algorithm
Inputs a String Which Acts as the Alphabet. Generates all Words with Letters in Reverse Alphabetical Order.


Problem Description:
A group of crafty robbers has devised an ingenious way to leave messages while keeping their communications hidden in plain sight from the police. They use a technique called "Robber's Code," where each word
follows a specific pattern: the letters within each word are arranged in strictly increasing alphabetical order. For example, the word "ace" follows this pattern as 'a' comes before 'c' and 'c' comes before 'e.' To
make their communication more secure they robbers implement one more secret operation(computation) on each message they send. Your challenge is to create a program to generate all the words that adhere to Robberâ€™s
Code (including the secret operation) using a given string as input.

The input will consist of a single string made up of letters and numbers. The characters inside the string will appear in alphabetical order(not necessarily the English Alphabetical order).

The string will be no longer than 20 characters long.


Sample Run:
Enter the Alphabet String:
ab9c

All Words with Letters in Reverse Alphabetical Order:
a
ba
9ba
c9ba
cba
9a
c9a
ca
b
9b
c9b
cb
9
c9
c
